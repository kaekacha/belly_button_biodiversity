# belly_button_biodiversity

Hello! This is Akadia's repository for the completed homework assignment #15 for the Georgia Tech Data Science & Analytics Boot Camp. It includes:

1-An index html file
2-A javascript file using the D3 library to manipulate the DOM
3-A JSON data file

The website delopyed (https://kaekacha.github.io/belly_button_biodiversity/) is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dashboard contains a table, a bar chart, a bubble chart, and a needle gauge to display information for an ID selected from the main page drop-down menu.

Thanks for stopping by!
